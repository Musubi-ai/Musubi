# Quicktour

Musubi-scrape provides convenient methods for crawling web text data. As the demand for advanced large language models (LLMs) continues to grow, building high-quality, large-scale text corpora has become essential for their development. The World Wide Web (WWW), a global, borderless, and open platform, provides abundant multimodal data—including text, images, and videos—that can be leveraged for this purpose. To date, crawling websites at scale has become a common approach for collecting such data. However, when it comes to crawling textual data, the main challenge lies not only in implementing scalable crawling across diverse website architectures but also in accurately extracting high-quality text—such as blog posts, news articles, and other written content—from websites. Musubi-scrape is specifically designed to address these challenges.

This quick tour introduces the main features of Musubi-scrape and demonstrates how to easily crawl web text data using the library.
