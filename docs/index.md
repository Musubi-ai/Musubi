# Musubi-scrape's Documentation

Musubi-scrape is a Python library designed for efficiently crawling and extracting website text, enabling users to construct scalable, domain-specific datasets from the ground up for training LLMs.

With Musubi-scrape, you can:

🕸️ Extract text data from most websites with common structures and transform them into markdown format.

🤖 Deploy AI agents to help you find optimal parameters for website crawling and implement crawling automatically.

📆 Set schedulers to schedule your crawling tasks.
